This is a guide to shopify theme development.
It is meant to outline the process in detail of what
it took me to develop my first shopify theme.

This theme will reflect a business attire ecommerce website.
Implementing shopify cli and liquid template.

Step 1:
Download Theme Kit:watches files for changes and syncs them with shopify.

Windows:Install theme kit with Chocolatey.
choco install themekit

Step 2:
Use the Theme Access app to obtain a Theme password to connect Theme Kit to your store and manage your template files.
Theme Access app
https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-access

Note: Uploading products to the product section via csv
seems simple. It seems you can browse products to upload.

Step 3: Add to both the product section and collection section.
Step 4:Create subfolders: A theme is made up of 7 folders
--assets(images,styles,javascript)files
style.css.liquid
scripts.js.liquid
img.jpg
----

--config(global theme settings(settings_schema.json))

--layout(theme.liquid)can hold other .liquid files but theme.liquid file is required.

--locales(holds translations)Will automatically translate store language when being used in another language.

--sections(partials with settings gives you the ability to add sections to your)

--snippets()
header.liquid
----

--templates(12files)
Holds liquid files:
404.liquid
article.liquid
blog.liquid
cart.liquid
collection.liquid
giftcard.liquid
list-collections.liquid
page.liquid
password.liquid
product.liquid
index.liquid
search.liquid
----
File general storage
layout folder-theme.liquid

Issue: Trouble connecting to different stores.

Resolution: Install theme kit access key to that specific store.This was done through the settings of the selected store. 
 ---theme configure -s store.myshopify.com -t (theme id number) -p (access key generated by theme kit access)---

 --Theme id number can be found in browser
 Upon successful connection a --config.yml-- package will be generated.
 --config.yml--file instructs theme kit which store to upload the changes to.
 
 Issue:theme watch --command
 Without using the proper flag a "cannot make changes to live theme without an override" error appears.

Resolution:-- theme watch --allow-live (flag)
This will allow theme kit to watch for changes to live theme.
If installed correctly, updates will be automatically applied to your shopify store.

step 5. Add index.liquid file to template folder.
This will generate original test message.
---liquid--
{% comment %} Add image {% endcomment %}
<img src="{{'puppy.jpg' alt="Puppy picture" |asset_url}}"/>
--end--
--liquid--
{% comment %} Link style sheet {% endcomment %}
{{'../assets/style.css'|asset_url | stylesheet_tag}}
--end--
--liquid--
{% comment %} Render header partial located in the snippets folder
The snippet folder contains partials of certain elements and are rendered as a tag{% render 'file.liquid'%}.This must be rendered from the index.liquid file.
 {% endcomment %}
{%render 'header'%}
--end--
--Note--
Note:liquid objects that can be rendered are located:
https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects -- 
--end Note
--Note--
Each file that is located in dev folders seem to have an object that corresponds to that file name. Example:the template folder contains a giftcard.liquid file, this file has an object
 {%- assign formatted_balance = gift_card.balance | money_without_trailing_zeros | strip_html -%}
--endNote--
--Note--
accessing objects and property format
{{shop.name}}--where as shop is the object and name is the
property. This will allow us to obtain a name instead of hard
coding one.
--endNote--
--liquid--
Note:when working with the main menu, the object is linklists--
The below code loops through the items in the list and produces its title.Wrapping each link in li tags seperates them from top to bottom.
<!-- Main menu -->
<ul>
{% for link in linklists.main-menu.links -%}
  <li>{{ link.title | link_to: link.url }}</li>
{%- endfor %}
</ul>



--end liquid--
